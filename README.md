# Sentiment-Analysis-API-Prototype

Developed an API that analyzes a text input in the URL after a "/" to return the sentiment analysis feedback as postive or negative based on polairty. The Azure DevOps deployment for testing the API is: https://mssentimentrun.azurewebsites.net

# Example Test Cases
https://mssentimentrun.azurewebsites.net/Great%20work!

Output: positive

https://mssentimentrun.azurewebsites.net/It%20is%20too%20cold%20outside

Output: negative

# Inspiration
I am currently building a tweeter application that fetches data from this API. This API can be used in other applications as well depending on what purpose it serves. 

This API is inspired by Dan Taylor's tutorials.
